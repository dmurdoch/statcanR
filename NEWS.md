# statcanR 0.2.2

* we replaced utils::read.csv by readr::read_csv to fix a random bug with some metadata tables.

# statcanR 0.2.1

* In this version, we have changed the name of the functions by withdrawing the sqs mentions. The old functions will remain available until the next update (deprecated).
