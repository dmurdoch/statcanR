## Resubmission

This is a resubmission (update). In this version I have :

*  modified the download function to get an informative message if the table (which is an Internet) is not available instead of having an error message. The goal is that the package which use internet resources fail gracefully with and informative message instead of an error if internet resources not available.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
* microsoft (on appveyor), R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is an update.
